# SFTW
This is my repository for Patrick Pagano's Scripting for the Web Class

For this project I chose to connect the Nexus UI to Tone.js in order to piece together an interesting Graphical User Interface 
for sound using a Javascripting language. I knew that tackling this scope of a project would prove difficult but
I was fairly hopeful that I would be able to make something awesome. After a semester long process, I wasn't able to do everything
I hoped and dreamed I'd be able to from when I started, but I learned a lot along the way especially in terms of how a Javascript language 
functions (in this case Tone.Js). I made the decision not to enhance the UI and make it prettier because I felt the design was actually
captivating for something on a mobile device. My intentions for the project, in theory, were very interesting "Have a bunch of dials/sliders,
that change a sound/manipulate it, and make it look pretty. To a great degree I've accomplished that, even if just looks like a Prototype.

I started this project by downloading the repository for Nexus and Tone.Js from the Github Patrick provided on blogger
https://github.com/nexus-js/ui/. I then proceeded to generate my own html file that would include a bunch of different GUI elements
from Nexus and I would later connect those to Tone.js. I was very ambitious until I failed repeatedly. I then tackled a smaller struggle
that would be editing an existing example file from the Github Patrick provided, and to my surprise I was able to actually get some things done.
I wouldn't say I "Made" something amazing, because I simply added elements to a file that had already been created, but I was able to generate
some code from scratch simply to get parts of the Nexus UI to work with Tone.js and for that I am very happy with myself.

In this Github I have included my SFTW folder and file called (demo.html --- located within the example folder, that's located within the UI-master
folder), for the review of Patrick Pagano for my Final Project/Class Grade.

I hope you see that I made an effort, and that although I may have failed to achieve what I hoped to achieve, I was relentless along the way.
